    name: "Henri Lefebvre",
    period: "1960s–1990s",
    influence: "Production of Space",
    keyIdeas: [
      "Production of space",
      "Spatial practice",
      "Everyday life as political"
    ],
    relevance:
      "Lefebvre provides the foundation for my work on how space is produced rather than given. His insistence that space is socially constructed informs my analysis of how digital platforms, infrastructures, and interfaces generate new spatial logics and redistribute agency."

    name: "Maurice Merleau-Ponty",
    period: "1940s–1960s",
    influence: "Phenomenology",
    keyIdeas: [
      "Embodied perception",
      "Lived experience",
      "Body–world entanglement"
    ],
    relevance:
      "Merleau-Ponty grounds my understanding of perception as embodied and situated. His work underpins my belief that meaning emerges through lived engagement with environments, shaping how I approach spatial interfaces, proxemics, and human–AI perception."

    name: "James J. Gibson",
    period: "1950s–1970s",
    influence: "Ecological Psychology",
    keyIdeas: [
      "Affordances",
      "Perception–action coupling",
      "Environment as active"
    ],
    relevance:
      "Gibson’s concept of affordances directly informs my framework for how environments make action possible. His ecological view of perception supports my work on environments as active participants in cognition rather than passive backdrops."

    name: "Edward T. Hall",
    period: "1950s–1970s",
    influence: "Proxemics & Cultural Anthropology",
    keyIdeas: [
      "Proxemics",
      "Culturally mediated space",
      "The silent language"
    ],
    relevance:
      "Hall’s work shapes my understanding of space as culturally encoded. His insights into distance, movement, and context inform my research on cultural world models and the limits of purely geometric or statistical approaches to spatial intelligence."

    id: 5,
    name: "Gordon Pask",
    period: "1960s–1990s",
    influence: "Cybernetics & Systems Theory",
    keyIdeas: [
      "Conversation theory",
      "Cybernetic feedback",
      "Learning systems"
    ],
    relevance:
      "Pask’s cybernetic view of learning and conversation underpins my treatment of communities as metacognitive systems. His work informs how I design feedback loops, participatory interfaces, and environments that adapt through interaction."

    id: 6,
    name: "Katherine McKittrick",
    period: "2000s–Present",
    influence: "Black Geographies",
    keyIdeas: [
      "Black spatial thought",
      "Demonic grounds",
      "Geography as lived experience"
    ],
    relevance:
      "McKittrick anchors my work in the realities of race, place, and history. Her articulation of Black spatial life ensures that my frameworks for space and computation remain accountable to lived experience rather than abstract universals."
